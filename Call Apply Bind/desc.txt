Execution Time:
call and apply immediately execute the function.
bind creates a new function that is executed separately.

Argument Passing:
call and apply accept arguments as a list (or an array-like object).
bind accepts arguments during the binding process 
and returns a new function with those arguments fixed.

Immediate vs. Delayed Execution:
call and apply immediately invoke the function with the provided context and arguments.
bind creates a new function that can be invoked later with the specified context and arguments.
