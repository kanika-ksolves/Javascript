Use debounce when you want to delay execution until after a period of inactivity 
following an event to save resources 
and provide a better user experience in scenarios with rapid events.

Use throttling when you want to limit the rate of execution to ensure a more consistent 
and controlled behavior in situations where the event occurs frequently.
