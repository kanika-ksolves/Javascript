//Memoization is a technique for speeding up applications by caching the results of expensive function calls and returning them when the same inputs are used again.
//expensive function call is one that consumes large amounts of these two resources: time and memory
//same as useMemo(react specific)
//caching used
Use concept of closure
We create a higher-order function memoize that takes a function func as an argument and returns a new function.
